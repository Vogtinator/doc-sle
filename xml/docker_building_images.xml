 <title>Creating Custom &docker; Images</title>
 <para>
  For creating your custom image, you need a base &docker; image of &productname;.
  You can use any of the pre-built &productname;. Download them as described in
  <xref linkend="Downloading_Pre-build_Images"/>.
 </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="Downloading_Pre-build_Images">
  <title>Downloading Base &slsa; Images</title>
  <para>
   How to obtain a pre-built base image depends on its &productname; version:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Up to &sle;&nbsp;12 SP2</term>
    <listitem>
     <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper in <replaceable>IMAGENAME</replaceable></screen>
     <para>
      For example, for &productname;&nbsp;11 SP4, use
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper in sles11sp4</screen>
     <para>
      After obtaining the image, you need to activate it. Proceed as follows:
     </para>

     <procedure>
      <title>Activating the Base Image for up to &slsa;&nbsp;12 SP2</title>
      <step>
       <para>
        Get the proper image name with <literal>sle2docker</literal> by running:
       </para>
       <screen>&prompt.user;sle2docker list</screen>
      </step>
      <step>
       <para>
        Activate the image by using the image name from the previous step:
       </para>
       <screen>&prompt.user;sle2docker activate <emphasis>PRE-BUILT_IMAGE_NAME</emphasis></screen>
      </step>
      <step>
       <para>
        Check if the image was successfully activated:
       </para>
       <screen>&prompt.user;sle2docker</screen>
      </step>
     </procedure>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>&sle;&nbsp;12 SP3 and later</term>
    <listitem>
     <screen>&prompt.user;docker pull registry.suse.com/suse/<replaceable>IMAGENAME</replaceable></screen>
     <para>
      For example, for &productname;&nbsp;15, use:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.user;docker pull registry.suse.com/suse/sle15</screen>
     <para>
      <literal>sle2docker</literal> is not needed, because the image is being
      pulled from the Docker registry.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>
   You can customize the &docker; image as described in
   <xref linkend="Customizing_Pre-build_Images"/>.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="Customizing_Pre-build_Images">
  <title>Customizing &slsa; &docker; Images</title>

  <para>
   The pre-built images do not have any repository configured and do not
   include any modules or extensions. They contain a
   <link xlink:href="https://github.com/SUSE/container-suseconnect">zypper
   service</link> that contacts either the &sccreg; or your
   &rmtool; (&rmt;) server, according to the configuration of
   the &productname; host that runs the &docker; container. The service obtains the list of
   repositories available for the product used by the &docker; image. You can
   also directly declare extensions in your <filename>Dockerfile</filename>
   (for details refer to
   <xref linkend="sec.docker.sle_images.customizing_the_images.extensions"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You do not need to add any credentials to the &docker; image because the
   machine credentials are automatically injected into the container by the
   <systemitem class="daemon">docker</systemitem> daemon. They are injected inside of the
   <literal>/run/secrets</literal> directory. The same applies to the
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file of the host system, which is
   automatically injected into the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Credentials and Security</title>

   <para>
    The contents of the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory are never
    committed to a &docker; image, hence there is no risk of your credentials
    leaking.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   To obtain the list of repositories, use the following command:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper ref -s</screen>

  <para>
   It will automatically add all the repositories to your container. For each
   repository added to the system a new file will be created under
   <command>/etc/zypp/repos.d</command>. The URLs of these repositories include
   an access token that automatically expires after 12 hours. To renew the
   token call the <command>zypper ref -s</command> command. It is secure to
   commit these files to a &docker; image.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to use a different set of credentials, place a custom
   <filename>/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials</filename> file inside of
   the &docker; image. It contains the machine credentials that have the
   subscription you want to use. The same applies to the
   <filename>SUSEConnect</filename> file: to override the file available on the
   host system that is running the &docker; container, add a custom
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file inside of the &docker; image.
  </para>

  <para>
   Now you can create a custom &docker; image by using a
   <literal>Dockerfile</literal>. Refer to the following sections:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <xref linkend="sec.docker.sle_images.customizing_the_images.sles12sp2"/>
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <xref linkend="sec.docker.sle_images.customizing_the_images.sles12sp3"/>
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   In case you would like to move your application to a &docker; container,
   refer to <xref linkend="docker.dockerizing.application"/>.
  </para>
  <para> After you have edited the <filename>Dockerfile</filename>, build the image by
   running the following command in the same directory in which the
   <filename>Dockerfile</filename> resides:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.user;docker build .</screen>

    application you want to run inside a &docker; container, see

 <!-- This section is commented out after discussion with Federica as KIWI
 should not be used for building base images outside SUSE. Even though it is
 possible, the only supported way is to activate pre-built images of SLES -->

   <title>Automation of Images Building</title>
   <para>
    In enterprise environment you typically need to automate your deployment
    process, from developer's commits to running the application. In case you
    use your own dockerregistry, you need to set up a pipeline between the
    versioning system and your private registry. To set up a pipeline you
    need to perform the following steps:
   </para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
     configure your versioning system to use hooks.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      choose any of continuous integration tools to receive the hooks and
      then to perform the build process.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      upload the built image to your docker registry.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
   <sect2 xml:id="Configuring.Versioning.System">
    <title>Configuring Versioning Systems</title>
    <para>
     Most of the currently used versioning systems enables you to configure
     hooks. As soon as you perform a particular action, the versioning system
     sends information to the continuos integration tool that a build should
     be performed. For example, in case of git used with Github, Github sends
     a <literal>POST</literal> request to configured URLs. You can select
     from various types of triggering events or use the default one -
     <literal>push</literal> to a configured branch.
    </para>
    <para>
     Your repository must contain besides your application source code, also
     a particular <filename>Dockerfile<filename> that defines your image.
